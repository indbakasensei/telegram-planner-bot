# JARVIS Bot — Version History

## v1.1 — Snooze / Postpone / Pause + Persistent Reminder Buttons (current)
Phase 1 of the roadmap — making reminders actionable instead of ignorable.

Added:
- Inline buttons on every reminder: ✅ Done, ⏰ Snooze 10m, 🕐 Snooze 1h, 📅 Tomorrow
- Tapping a button acts instantly (no typing needed)
- Snooze: temporarily silences a reminder, re-fires after the chosen delay
- Postpone: moves a task to tomorrow in one tap
- /pause <id> — stop all reminders for a task without deleting it
- /resume <id> — turn reminders back on
- /paused — list all paused tasks
- Scheduler now respects paused flag and snooze_until timestamp
- last_reminded tracking (groundwork for v2.0 escalation)

New DB columns: paused, snooze_until, last_reminded
New functions: snooze_task, postpone_task, pause_task, resume_task, mark_reminded, get_paused_tasks
Modified: main.py (inline buttons, handle_callback, pause/resume/paused commands),
          scheduler.py (pause + snooze aware), database.py

## v1.0 — Debug & Bug-Tracking System
Built the debugging foundation FIRST, as the roadmap recommends, before
adding more features. This makes every future version easier to test and fix.

Added:
- /debug — toggle debug mode (shows detected intent + entities + parsed date/time inline after each message)
- /report <description> — report a bug; auto-captures your last message and what the bot understood
- /bugs — list all open bug reports
- /resolve <id> — mark a bug resolved
- /trace — show the last AI interaction in detail (input, intent, entities, reply)
- /selftest — get the full test-message checklist to run through
- Automatic exception logging — every crash is auto-saved to bugs.db with full traceback and context
- Separate bugs.db database so debug data never touches your task data
- Interaction history stored (last 50 per user) for tracing

New file: debug_system.py
Modified: main.py (wired in all debug commands + auto exception logging + debug output)
